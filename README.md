# Death-Box
Death Box is an arcade-style game that I made as my final project for computer science during my sophomore year in high school. The object of the game is to survive against infinite waves of enemies with increasing difficulty, as well as extra surprises throughout the levels.

The Final Project folder is the Unity Project folder, which can be downloaded to edit my game in Unity.

The Code folder can be viewed to see the examples of code I created during the making of this game.

The Executable folder can be downloaded and used to play Death Box on any Windows PC(Designed for Windowed 1024x768 resolution).
